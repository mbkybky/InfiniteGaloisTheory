# Basic properties of Profinite Groups

* `ofContinuousMulEquivProfiniteGrp` : If a topological group have a two-sided continuous
  isomorphism to a profinite group then it is profinite as well.

* `ofClosedSubgroup` : The closed subgroup of a profinite group is profinite.

* `finiteIndex_of_open_subgroup` : An open subgroup of a profinite group has finite index.
